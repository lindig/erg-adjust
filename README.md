# Weight-adjusted Ergonometer Times

In competitive rowing, ergonometer tests are used to assess fitness of
athletes and the 2000m test is the standard. The ability to generate
power is dependent on body weight. The exact relation between body
weight and power depends on more factors and the relation to boat speed
is even more complicated: see [Physics of Rowing]. However, the formula
made popular by [C2] is generally accepted as a measure of fitness.

Below is a graph where lines connect points of equal fitness. It is
generated by the R code in this repository.
